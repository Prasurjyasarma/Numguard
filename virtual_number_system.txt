NUMGUARD - VIRTUAL NUMBER SYSTEM

HOW IT WORKS:

1. PHYSICAL NUMBER LINKING
   - Each user has one physical number
   - Physical number can link up to 3 virtual numbers
   - Each virtual number must be in a different category

2. CATEGORY SYSTEM
   Three main categories:
   ├── E-commerce
   ├── Social Media
   └── Personal

3. VIRTUAL NUMBER CREATION
   Steps:
   1. Select category (e-commerce/social/personal)
   2. System generates unique virtual number
   3. Links to your physical number
   4. 5-minute cooldown between creations in same category

4. NUMBER MANAGEMENT
   Features:
   ├── Activate/Deactivate numbers
   ├── Toggle message/call features
   ├── Delete numbers (with recovery option)
   └── View message history

5. MESSAGE HANDLING
   - Messages sent to virtual number
   - Forwarded to your physical number
   - Organized by category
   - Real-time updates

6. RECOVERY SYSTEM
   - Deleted numbers can be recovered
   - 5-minute recovery cooldown

EXAMPLE SCENARIO:
